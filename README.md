# Brainfunc - A Functional Brainfuck Interpreter Written in Ruby

This is yet another implementation of the [Brainfuck Interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck). The style of implementation of this interpreter is mostly functional (avoids mutations, sideeffects for the most part). The core of the VM itself is written in ~39 lines of ruby (heavily golfed)

## Roadmap

1. Improve Performance
2. Improve Docs + Code Readability
